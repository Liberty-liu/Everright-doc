# Form Validation
Validation is mainly applied to Input type form elements, which can ensure that the data entered by users meets specific rules and requirements, such as maximum character count, minimum character count, URL format, email format, phone number format, ID card format, and so on.

In addition to Input type form elements, other types of form elements only undergo required field validation to ensure that users fill in necessary information.  For example, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus typically only need to be marked as required and ensure that users fill in the corresponding options.

In the attribute panel, you can select the required field option for these types of form elements to ensure that users do not omit necessary information when submitting the form.  Additionally, you can provide placeholder text and default values for these form elements to improve user experience and form usability.

Built-in Chinese and English validation messages are available.
